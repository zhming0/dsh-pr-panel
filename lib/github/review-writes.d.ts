/**
 * Write to the review threads or the pending review of a pull request. One read first checks that the head is still
 * `write.headSha`, finds the signed-in user's pending review, and, for a write to a thread or comment, that the pull
 * request holds it; a moved head returns `stale` and a thread or comment elsewhere `failed`, both without writing. A
 * pending reply without a pending review first starts an empty one at `write.headSha`; when the reply then fails, that
 * empty review stays. A reply at once is refused with `failed` while the user has a pending review, since GitHub would
 * add it to that review. Mutations send their variables as JSON on stdin, and none is retried: a refusal GitHub reports
 * returns `failed`, and an answer that does not show whether GitHub applied a mutation returns `unknown`.
 * @param read - runs the check as one GraphQL request.
 * @param gh - bounded, cancellable GitHub CLI runner for the mutations.
 * @param ref - pull request, with an owner and name already checked for inlining.
 * @param write - the write and the head commit the user saw.
 * @param signal - cancellation of the check and the mutations.
 * @returns whether GitHub took the write.
 * @throws with `signal.reason` when the signal aborts before a mutation is sent.
