/**
 * Read the unified patch from the merge base of `base` and `head` to `head`, as
 * GitHub computes the diff of a pull request with that base and head commit.
 * Both ends are commit object names, so the answer never follows a moving
 * branch. The patch keeps terminal escape sequences that file contents hold:
 * `gh` 2.97 and newer refuses to print them without `--allow-escape-sequences`,
 * and an older `gh`, which rejects that option, prints them unchanged, so a
 * rejection of the option alone repeats the read without it.
 * GitHub returns the patch however many files it changes; `read` bounds its size.
 * @param read - runs `gh` with the provider's output limit and failure mapping.
 * @param repository - repository that holds both commits, with an owner and name already checked for inlining.
 * @param base - commit whose merge base with `head` starts the patch.
 * @param head - commit the patch ends at.
 * @param signal - cancellation of the read.
 * @returns the patch with `a/` and `b/` path prefixes, or why GitHub did not provide it.
 * @throws when `base` or `head` is not a full commit object name.
